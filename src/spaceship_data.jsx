        title:"Clone Z-95 Fighter",
        text:"Though an outdated starfighter, the Z-95 boasts endurance and adaptability. The clone pilots of the Galactic Republic used the Z-95 Headhunter during the Clone Wars. A multi-purpose starfighter, the Z-95 has spawned countless variants, with the Republic making its own mark on the Headhunter's large production run with a clone trooper-specific model. The Z-95 is largely recognized as a respectable and versatile snub-fighter of its era, and was the forerunner of the incredibly successful X-wing starfighter.",

        text:"With the outbreak of the Clone Wars, the Jedi were pressed into the forefront of military activity, serving as generals in the campaign against the Separatists. The demands of combat drove advancements in the Jedi starfighter arsenal, resulting in modifications to existing craft and a new generation of fighters. The Eta-2 was smaller than the earlier Delta-7 but boasted greater firepower. Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi flew Eta-2s during the Battle of Coruscant, where Obi-Wan’s fighter was badly damaged by Separatist buzz droids. Some design elements of the Eta-2 were later incorporated into the Empire’s TIE fighters.",

The cruiser's deadly two-step attack begins with knocking out the power systems of a target vessel with its primary weapon. Then the cruiser finishes off the defenseless spacecraft with blasts from its secondary laser cannons and turbolaser batteries.",

The wings are on a collared mount, which can rotate independently from the hull, offering the ship remarkable maneuverability for a fighter of its size. In addition, the Gauntlet packs a punch, carrying two forward laser cannons and a pair of rearward-facing cannons that flank its boarding tube.",

Curved insect-like landing gears lower from the ship's belly, giving the craft's legs a pincer-like appearance as it settles on a landing pad.",

A roughly cylindrical warship, the cruiser's surface was dotted with heavy weapons capable of piercing through the shields and hulls of enemy vessels. The bridge of the cruiser was located on a platform resting atop the bow of the vessel. Towards the aft end of the craft was a towering fin-like spire that rose from the rest of the hull. Within this spire were the General's Quarters, a command center with tactical displays, briefing table, and an observation deck with a view of surrounding space.",

The disk is broken at the front of the craft, revealing two mammoth docking bays lined with forward docking claws. The reclusive Neimoidian commanders typically seal themselves in the ship's spacious bridge while their legions of droids handle the operation of the mighty craft. The most important vessel in a Separatist battleship flotilla is the Droid Control Ship, which transmitted signals to the battle droid armies used by the Trade Federation and Separatist forces.",

The craft’s blaster cannons and concussion missile launchers gave it a formidable weapons complement. Many of its technologies were later adapted for the V-wing fighter. V-19s were tricky to fly, as the bounty hunter Cad Bane discovered when he stole one to escape from the Jedi Cruiser Resolute.",
